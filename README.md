Introduction
======================================
I am currently a senior in the Program of Liberal Studies with a minor in Data Science at the Unversity of Notre Dame. My interdisciplinary curriculum has honed my communication and critical thinking skills alongside my ability to work with data structures. Furthermore, these skills support my passion for storytelling with quantitative and qualitative methods. Lately, I have been building an AI toolkit in prompting and exploring AI applications. 

Skills: Python, R

Data Science Projects
======================================

This directory contains a list of the data science projects that I have worked on throughout my time as a student at Notre Dame. Please refer to the section below for a brief explanation of each project and a link to further details.

I am currently working on an app in streamlit in my data science class. By the end of the semester, I hope to complete that project with a comprehensive knowledge of VS code, GitHub, and Streamlit, as well as to achieve a functional app. 

**Tidy Data Project (March 2025)** 
This project demonstrates my skills of data cleaning in service of creating visualizations that are clear and informative. I used the Olympics 2008 data to complete this project.

**ML Streamlit App Project (April 2025)**
This app takes a csv inputted by the user and performs supervised machine learning on it, outputting metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model is adaptable to the user's needs and specific data. This project demonstrates a further step in my journey to grow my data science skill set, as I drew on the data cleaning principles I learned previously in this project as well. Machine learning exponentially increases the data-based outcomes users can have, so developing my coding and deployment skills in that area is important.
