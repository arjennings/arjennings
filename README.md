Introduction
======================================
I am currently a senior in the Program of Liberal Studies with a minor in Data Science at the Unversity of Notre Dame. My interdisciplinary curriculum has honed my communication and critical thinking skills alongside my ability to work with data structures. Furthermore, these skills support my passion for storytelling with quantitative and qualitative methods. Lately, I have been building an AI toolkit in prompting and exploring AI applications. 

Skills: Python, R

Data Science Projects
======================================

This directory contains a list of the data science projects that I have worked on throughout my time as a student at Notre Dame. Please refer to the section below for a brief explanation of each project and a link to further details.

I am currently working on an app in streamlit in my data science class. By the end of the semester, I hope to complete that project with a comprehensive knowledge of VS code, GitHub, and Streamlit, as well as to achieve a functional app.
