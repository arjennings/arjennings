Introduction
======================================
I am currently a senior in the Program of Liberal Studies with a minor in Data Science at the Unversity of Notre Dame. My interdisciplinary curriculum has honed my communication and critical thinking skills alongside my ability to work with data structures. Furthermore, these skills support my passion for storytelling with quantitative and qualitative methods. Lately, I have been building an AI toolkit in prompting and exploring AI applications. 

Skills: Python, R

Data Science Projects
======================================

This directory contains a list of the data science projects that I have worked on throughout my time as a student at Notre Dame. Please refer to the section below for a brief explanation of each project and a link to further details.

I am currently working on an app in streamlit in my data science class. By the end of the semester, I hoped to complete that project with a comprehensive knowledge of VS code, GitHub, and Streamlit, as well as to achieve a functional app. I made two successful streamlit projects. In the future, I plan to continue developing my skills as I apply them to other projects that support my personal interests and professional goals. I am not entering the Data Science field, but I know these skills are applicable in so many ways. Particularly when it comes to sports, which are a personal passion and professional interest of mine, good data science skills are essential.

**Tidy Data Project (March 2025)** 
This project demonstrates my skills of data cleaning in service of creating visualizations that are clear and informative. I used the Olympics 2008 data to complete this project.

**ML Streamlit App Project (April 2025)**
This app takes a csv inputted by the user and performs supervised machine learning on it, outputting metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model is adaptable to the user's needs and specific data. This project demonstrates a further step in my journey to grow my data science skill set, as I drew on the data cleaning principles I learned previously in this project as well. Machine learning exponentially increases the data-based outcomes users can have, so developing my coding and deployment skills in that area is important.

**Unsupervised ML Streamlit App (May 2025)**
This interactive Streamlit app enables users to explore patterns in customer data through unsupervised machine learning techniques. Because it is unsupervised, this app emphasizes exploration and trial and error. Users can upload their own datasets or use a sample dataset and then choose numeric features, perform dimensionality reduction with PCA, and apply clustering methods (KMeans or Hierarchical) to identify meaningful groups.
